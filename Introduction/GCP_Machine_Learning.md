**What is Machine Learning?**
	* Newest field in computer science in which machines can learn and adapt new things through experience, without having to be explicitly programmed to do so.
			* When exposed to new data, a ML app can learn from it without external input

	* Machine learning can be simply defined as creating applications that can see, hear and understand the world around them. This is a new class of intelligent applications.

	* Big Data and Machine Learning go hand in hand

**Why does machine learning matter?**
	* Machine learning is the next frontier in technology innovation
	* All of the major technology companies are making it a focus
	* Practical applications include:
		* Predictive protection against cyber-crime, using big data models
		* Automatic identification of images (Google Photos)
		* Real time language translation
			* Text, audio, and even images
		* Voice to text dictation and vice versa
		* Smartphone personal assistants - Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa
			* Automated notifications of when to leave for an appointment
		* Automates tasks in analyzing big data
		* In the future - self driving cars

**Google Cloud and Machine Learning**
	* Google’s ML services are faster and more accurate than its competitors
		* Google is by far a leader in ML capabilities
	* Uses the same ML resources that Google uses for their own products such as Google Photos, Translate, and Google Assistant
	* Built on Tensorflow - Google’s Open source tool to build and run neural network models
		* Released in 2015 as an open source ML platform for anyone to use
		* Make it easier for developers to design, build, and train deep learning models
		* Previously used internally at Google for their own Deep Learning data flows
		* Works on a large variety of platforms
	* Create your own machine learning service on GCP’s Machine Learning Engine
		* Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine is a managed service that enables you to easily build machine learning models that work on any type of data, of any size.
			* Since it is managed, no resource allocation necessary
		* Ideal for custom predictive analytics
		* Create own model with Tensorflow framework
			* Open source
		* Tightly integrates with Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and other Big Data resources
		* Supports thousands of users and TB’s of data
	* Pre-trained machine learning models built by Google
	* Vision: understand the content of an image by identifying objects, landmarks, text, explicit content without manually tagging each image
		* Classify image into thousands of categories (boat, lion, car, etc)
		* Detect inappropriate content
		* Find topical web items such as celebrities, logos, and events
		* Detect and extract text for OCR - automatic language detection
	* Natural Language: reveal the structure and meaning of text, including language detection

		* extract information about people, places, events and much more, mentioned in text documents, news articles or blog posts. 
		* understand written sentiment about your product on social media or parse intent from customer conversations happening in a call center or a messaging app.
	* Translate: language detection and translation
	* Speech: convert audio to text and vice versa
		* stream results in real-time
		* Over 110 languages supported
	* Video Intelligence - newest option, unique to Google
		* Makes videos searchable by content
		* Automatically label objects and people in videos
		* Detect scene transitions and search within a scene

**GCP Machine Learning use cases**
	* Structured data
		* Forecasting customer demand
		* Product upsells on product website
		* Fraud detection - detect anomalies in data
	* Unstructured data
		* Language identification
		* With image detection - Inspect packages for damage
